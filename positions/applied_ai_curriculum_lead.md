# Applied AI curriculum lead

## ABOUT US

In 2035, Africa will have the largest workforce in the world and will need to catalyze transformation by empowering its largest untapped resource - its people.
Fueled by this, the [African Leadership Group](https://algroup.org/) is an ecosystem of institutions with a shared vision to harness Africa's abundant human capital and transform the continent and the world by selecting, developing, and connecting 2 million young leaders to opportunities by 2030.
ALG was founded over 15 years ago by [Fred Swaniker](https://time.com/collection/100-most-influential-people-2019/5567703/fred-swaniker/), a serial entrepreneur recognized by Time Magazine as one of the 100 most influential people of 2019.
ALX and The Room are two brands of the [African Leadership Group](https://algroup.org/). 


**ALX is our training arm**, focused on developing skills for the fourth industrial revolution (software engineering, devops, data science, etc.) to ensure that Africa is able to compete effectively as the world undergoes a digital transformation.
To cement this, through our legal entity  African Leadership International (ALI), we have signed an agreement to acquire Silicon Valley based Holberton Inc. – a project-based, college alternative educating the next generation of software engineers.
This will give us ownership of the advanced technology program that will enable us to provide global organizations access to significant untapped pools of talent that can bridge the growing global shortage of technology talent.

**The Room**, our talent placement arm, is a community that our young talent join to access global work opportunities.

## ABOUT THE TEAM

The SE team is managing the [Software Engineering](https://www.alxafrica.com/software-engineering-plus/) and the [Intro to Software Engineering](https://www.alxafrica.com/intro-to-software-engineering/) programs at ALX - the entire team is dedicated to learners.
We are responsible for hundreds of thousands of learners.


## ABOUT THE ROLE

AI is changing everything around us.
It's in our phones, cars, and even our homes.
Because AI is becoming a big part of our lives, it's important for learners to understand how it works, how they can use it, and what they can build with it.
Our new program will help learners learn about AI and how to use it.
By offering this course, we want to make sure our learners are ready for the future where AI will play an even bigger role.

This course will not be about how to create an AI from scratch, but rather, how to use existing AIs as tools to help, learn, create and build.
The applied AI course will be project-based and will showcase small projects and tutorials on how to use these AI tools.
It will be about discovering and testing the latest AI technologies. 


Eventually, there will be two levels to this course:
- Level 1 - "Discover", that will not require coding skills
- Level 2 - "Build", that will require coding skills


Example of potential small project for Level 1 - "Discover":
- Using ChatGPT the right way for every day challenges
- Create an rap song with AI - [https://twitter.com/julienbarbier42/status/1651460956600549376](https://twitter.com/julienbarbier42/status/1651460956600549376)
- Create mind blowing photos and art - [https://www.instagram.com/0xjulienbarbier/](https://www.instagram.com/0xjulienbarbier/)
- Etc...


Example of potential small project for Level 2 - "Build":
- Use ChatGPT to create a video game in less than a day - [https://twitter.com/julienbarbier42/status/1654664825048567809?s=20](https://twitter.com/julienbarbier42/status/1654664825048567809?s=20)
- Use Co-pilot-like AIs to 10x your performance as a software engineer
- Etc...


We are seeking a highly motivated, hardworking, and organized individual to join our team to create, lead and animate the applied AI program.
