# Cover Letter for Intern Developer Assistant Position

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Intern Developer Assistant position at the African Leadership Group. I am excited about the opportunity to work with a team that is dedicated to harnessing Africa's human capital and transforming the continent through the development and connection of young leaders.

I am particularly impressed with ALX, the training arm of the African Leadership Group, and its focus on developing skills for the fourth industrial revolution. The acquisition of Holberton Inc. will enable ALX to provide global organizations access to untapped pools of talent, and I am eager to contribute to this initiative.

I have strong knowledge in programming, and I am confident that my skills and experience will be an asset to the tech team. I have excellent oral and written communication skills in English and am comfortable with using tools such as Slack, Google Drive, and GitHub.

I believe in humanity's ability to self-improve and am passionate about leveraging technology, streamlined systems, and data to solve human-centric problems. I am dedicated to taking on audacious goals and breaking them down into near-term deliverables that provide value to business stakeholders. I also enjoy educating my peers and business partners about engineering best practices.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience can contribute to the African Leadership Group's mission.

Sincerely, </br>
Reny Kipkoech.
